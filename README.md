## What is a git merge conflict? A merge conflict arises when Git cannot automatically resolve code differences between two commits.

## Step 1: The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes.
 Step 2: After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content.
 Step 3: The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command.
